# Executive Summary

***

## The Process

- We immediately began the project by creating a GitHub repo for it [here](https://github.com/samuelludwig/sem-project), this was done to make keeping track of files and progress easier, the project itself is also easier to share. We got by without really utilizing git branches or issues all that much, but we should have used them more than we had. 
- Two files were made, `req_breakdown.md` and `attr_breakdown.md`. `req_breakdown.md` held our breakdown of the requirements we parsed from the Project Scenario, and was later ammended after all interview questions were asked. `attr_breakdown.md` held a breakdown of the parts of the system and what attributes they would have. These two files gave us a solid reference point for when it came to questions like "what do we include in this part of the system", and made further compartmentalization simpler.
- The next step was to create a burndown list, this helped us keep track of what needed doing and let us compartmentalize the project more easily. The weighting of the burndown list changed a couple of times over the course of the project, but not in any way that would be considered major.
- All text-based files would be written in Markdown, this was for a few reasons: Markdown is simple to use, it assures that we would have relatively uniform document styling (especially if a linter is used), and lastly because GitHub, like most sites, automatically converts Markdown to an even more easily readable form.
- [Lucidchart](https://www.lucidchart.com/) would be used to create all of our diagrams due to its ease of use and convenience, in addition to having a decent free account option.\*
- A core axiom was followed throughout the project: "We will lean on the request for *abbreviated* systems as much as possible".

## The Good

- Due to the decisions we had made towards the beginning of the project, reasoning about the work itself was effectively frictionless.
- We did not feel too particularly rushed as we began working on the project relatively quickly, not to say that our schedule couldn't have been improved of course.

## The Bad

- \*Lucidchart is great to use, unless you want to use it for making UI wireframes, the tools for those are only included in the *pro* plan. Did that stop us? No. Should it have? Yes. What I'm getting at here is- please don't expect our UI to be great; I'm not a front-end guy, but I did what I could using UML diagram peices to create a UI, it's not going to be the Mona Lisa.
- \*Did you know that if you have multiple pages in a project on Lucidchart, and you do a Ctrl-F find-and-replace operation on a page, that it will apply that find-and-replace to *all* pages in the project? Because I didn't until this morning, and I used it frequently. So, if it seems like there's any words in the UI that are misplaced or don't belong, that's why.
- We were not aware of the need to include costs/cost explanations/options per section of the system until May 1st, and by then implementing them by module would be a significant effort, as all the peices had been more or less completed. Seeing as implementing individual costs and cost options/explanations would be considered all too drastic Scope Creep at this point in time, the following section is offered:

## The Cost

- A reasonable up-front fee of $3,000,000 in addition to $200,000 every year after delivery for maintenence costs, of course considering that the ECAM funds it's own phsyical maintenence costs for the servers/security/etc.
- Price/overall system is non-negotiable, this is not Build-A-Bear.
