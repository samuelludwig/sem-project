# Training Plan

***

Training of the ECAM employees on the use of the software will be executed as follows:

1. Determine designated "mentors" among the staff -staff whose official roles include 'trainer' or 'mentor' or staff who otherwise volunteer-.
2. Gather designated mentors into a "lecture room" so that all have access to a workstation with the implemented system.
3. Take the mentors through the system one module at a time:
   1. Employee account management/access.
   2. Drawing/Model management/access.
   3. Part management/access.
   4. Aircraft-production management/access.
   5. Order management/access.
   6. General security outline (Discuss RFID chips/biometrics/permissions/etc.).
4. Film/record all instructions, breaking up the recordings to a per module basis. These recordings may be accessed at any time by ECAM for instructional or referential purposes.
