# Security Plan

***

## Access

- Every employee will be given an ID card, with their employee ID number embedded on an RFID chip in the card.
- This card will need to be scanned to enter into any room containing business information, including all entrances to the building.
- Access to any workstation or the server room will require the RFID chip to be read along with a biometric lock to be bypassed.

## Workstations

- No business data will be contained directly on the workstations, only the programs necessary to perform operations will be placed on the workstations, the programs will call for any sensitive information from the system's servers.
- Workstations will automatically logoff after (5) minutes of inactivity.
- Workstations will have no access to the outside internet, only the ECAM wired intranet, no wireless access anywhere.

## Servers

- The system's servers will be located on the second story of the two story building.
- The servers will be located in a singular, large room, with only one door.
- All entrants into the server room will need their employee IDs pre-approved by a superior (ideally a system administrator) before entering, otherwise the scanner will not accept their RFID and will not let them in.
- It is recommended to have security guards throughout the building, with two at minimum permanently stationed outside of the server room at all times.
- Additional RFID scanners will be placed on each server cabniet, when permission to access the server room is given, it is also only given for particular/a particular server cabniet(s), it will not accept the RFID if it is not approved.
- In the event of a fire in the server room, there will be a system in place that may be activated which will remove all oxygen from the room until it is deactivated.
